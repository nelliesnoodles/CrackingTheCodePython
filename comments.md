### chapter 1 problem 6 :  2-25-2021
() example::  'astring' + 'bstring' = "astringbstring"
Because of Python's ability to 'build strings' I don't think the Java Stringbuilder method is necessary to deplete the complexity of the solution.
I could totally be wrong.

### chapter1 problem 9 : 2-26-2021
The author uses 'rotation' and 'permutation' in the problem description.
Because I wanted to try before I looked at the solution, there is an extra method/function in the file that finds if a string is a permutation of the first one. 
It's the same string, just scrambled.  

The solution did not want this resolution, but I left it in for prosterity.

Because there are many differences in the way C implements memory allocation, Just keep in mind that with Python a whole lot of work is done under the hood 
that we will never have to worry about.   

_Example:  Garbage Collection_
