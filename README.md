# CrackingTheCodePython
I'm going to work through the problems in the book Cracking the Coding Interview, but with Python.
Currently I believe the problems are solved in Java.

The book Cracking the Coding Interview is written by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

I will only be solving the code problems in the book and will not be discussion any other content.
Buy the book.  Is good.
