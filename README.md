# CrackingTheCodePython
5/15/2021
I am going to work through chapter 1 and include Vanilla JavaScript solutions

I'm going to work through the problems in the book Cracking the Coding Interview, but with Python.
Currently I believe the problems are solved in Java.

The book Cracking the Coding Interview is written by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

I will only be solving the code problems in the book and will not be discussion any other content.
Buy the book.  Is good. 
The book contains solutions and hints for these problems, I believe they are Java and C++ focused.


A comment file will store all additional information and comments for the repo concerning solutions or the repo.
